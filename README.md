# Portfolio Site

What can I say? This portfolio and it's contained projects represents a year of my life. I had a lot of fun and stress and late nights putting together my projects.  This portfolio comes at the end of my journey with the Thinkful flex bootcamp, but it's by no means the end of my learning. That is just beginning.

Live portfolio site: [https://enshaednhiker.github.io/portfolio-site/](https://enshaednhiker.github.io/portfolio-site/)

## Getting Started

Ha! No instructions! All the assets for the project are contained in here and I've just used vanilla JS. Not an NPM package in sight. If you wanted to rip off my portfolio, you could just clone it with: 

```
git clone https://github.com/EnshaednHiker/portfolio-site.git
```
